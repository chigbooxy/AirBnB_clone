![Airbnb project image](hbnb.png)
## Project Description

Welcome to the Airbnb Console Clone â€“ a simplified command-line interface (CLI). This project is built as part of the ALX's curriculum project and provides an interactive shell for managing instances of different classes, such as User, amenity, city, place, state, review and the BaseModel where all other classes inherits from.

## Command Interpreter Description
The command interpreter is a fundamental component of the Airbnb Console Clone project, providing an interactive shell for users to interact with the application. It serves as a text-based interface where users can input commands to perform various operations, including creating, displaying, updating, and deleting instances of different classes.

### Key Features:

- **User-friendly-interface:** The command interpreter offers a straightforward and intuitive interface, making it easy for users to navigate and execute commands.
- **CRUD Operations:** Users can seamlessly perform Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations on instances of different classes within the application.(User, Amenity, City, State, Review and BaseModel).
- **Dynamic handling:** - The interpreter dynamically handles different classes, allowing users to work with multiple models such as BaseModel and User.
- **Command Interpreter:** Utilize a command-line interface to interact with the application.
- **Data Serialization:** The interpreter interacts with a custom FileStorage class, ensuring proper serialization and deserialization of data to and from JSON files for persistent storage.
